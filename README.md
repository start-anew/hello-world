# hello-world

Hello humans, this is my first attempt at learning GitHub via internal tutorial. Lets see how it goes!

I am highly interested in software development and plan to continue my educational career through PSU. So far I have graduated with an associates degree and plan on earning my bachelors in computer science. As a student the majority of my focus and energy goes into my education. This results in my work experience being quite slim. Although because of this, I am very eager and motivated to explore opportunities in the workforce to prove my skills and interests. I spend my free time learning programming and various types of development through languages such as JavaScript, Python, HTML, and much more that I plan to be as proficient in as I possibly can. Currently, Web Development looks the most appealing to me but I am extremely interested in developing games and applications via desktop and mobile devices, and hope this could be the true industry I could someday succeed in. I am very proactive, organized, optimistic, proficient, and highly eager to prove my skills and abilities to succeed and grow not only myself but the employer.

Thank you for your time!
